# Census-Income-Prediction

## Overview
The Census Income Prediction project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict income levels.

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SanyamGarg12/Census-Income-Prediction
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Census-Income-Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook main.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
